The task is to visualize a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics.

Find a correlation between two data variables, each measured state by state and taken from different data sources. Then visualize the correlation with a scatter plot and embed the graphic into an .html file.


Plot requirements:

* The x-values of the circles should match the demographic census data, while the y-values should represent the risk data.

* Include state abbreviations in the circles.

* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

* Generate this chart in the `d3.html` file in your assignment directory.

* Note: You'll need to use `http-server` to display the graphic since you're pulling data in from a source outside of your app.js file.

* Embed into an iframe

* Include two more demographics and two more risks. Place additional labels in your scatter plot and give them click events so that your users can decide which data to display. Animate the transitions for your circles' locations as well as the range of your axes.

* Add tooltips.

* Make it responsive.
